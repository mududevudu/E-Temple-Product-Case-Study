# E-Temple: A Product Case Study

_Exploring our traditions through a scientific lens._

---

## üöÄ The Elevator Pitch

E-Temple is a digital platform designed as a one-stop solution for organizing Hindu religious ceremonies. This case study outlines the product strategy‚Äîfrom user research and problem validation to MVP definition and future roadmap‚Äîfor an app that connects modern, urban families with a network of trusted, traditional service providers.

## üéØ The Problem

As individuals and families migrate to Tier-1 cities for professional opportunities, they often become disconnected from the community and elder guidance that traditionally facilitates religious customs. This creates a two-sided market problem:

#### For Consumers
- **Lack of Knowledge:** Unfamiliarity with the correct procedures for performing pujas and rituals.
- **Lack of Access:** Difficulty finding and vetting trusted priests, caterers, and decorators in a new city.
- **Lack of Time:** Busy professional lives make it challenging to manage the elaborate preparations required for ceremonies.

#### For Suppliers
- **Limited Reach:** Skilled, traditional service providers (priests, caterers) struggle with online visibility and acquiring new clients.
- **Digital Gap:** Many are not tech-savvy and find it difficult to compete in an increasingly digital-first market.

## ‚ú® The Goal & Proposed Solution

To design a seamless, trustworthy, and modern platform that empowers users to confidently practice their customs and provides suppliers with a simple gateway to a wider digital market. The solution is **E-Temple**, a stand-alone mobile application for the Hindu religion.

## üë• Target Audience

The platform serves two main groups, validated through detailed user personas:

- **Consumers:** Tech-savvy individuals (28-35 years old) like newlyweds, nuclear family heads, and busy professionals who have moved to a new city, value their heritage, but lack the local knowledge and network to practice it.
- **Suppliers:** Experienced and skilled service providers (priests, decorators, specialty caterers) who form the backbone of the traditional ecosystem but need a platform to grow their business online.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Process & Prioritization

This case study followed a standard product design process, including user persona development, pain point analysis, and feature prioritization using the **RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) framework**. The key strategic decision was to prioritize the **"desire for a modern and tech-friendly solution to stay connected with heritage,"** as it scored highest on impact and confidence with a manageable level of effort.

## üì± The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The core features defined for the initial product launch include:

- **Personalized Onboarding:** Capturing user details, location, and crucially, regional and religious preferences to tailor all recommendations.
- **Service Marketplace:** A platform to discover, read reviews for, and book verified priests, decorators, and caterers.
- **E-commerce for Rituals:** A storefront to browse and purchase customized Pooja kits, essential items, and authentic, traditional food dishes.
- **Guided Rituals:** The key differentiator. The app provides **scientifically explained audio cues and transcripts**, allowing users to understand the meaning behind rituals and perform them correctly on their own.

## üìà Business Model & Success Metrics

#### Revenue Streams
A hybrid revenue model is proposed:
1.  **Commission-Based:** A **15-20% commission** on all services booked and products sold through the platform.
2.  **Subscription Model:** A future plan to convert users to a premium subscription for advanced features, with a target conversion rate of 10%.

#### Key Metrics for Success
- **Activation:** Total number of new user signups; number of users completing their first order.
- **Engagement:** Average time spent per session; number of returning users per month.
- **Revenue:** Average order value; total number of services booked per month.

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

Beyond the MVP, the future roadmap includes features to increase user engagement and ease of use:

- **Enhanced Guided Rituals:** Introducing **video and interactive cues** for a more immersive experience.
- **"Find the Muhurat" Feature:** An expert consultation service to connect users with priests for determining auspicious timings for events.
- **Community Building:** Features to connect like-minded individuals in new cities to practice traditions together.
